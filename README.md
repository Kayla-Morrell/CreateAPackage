# Create A Package

# Instructor(s) name(s) and contact information

* Kayla Interdonato: kayla.morrell@roswellpark.org
* Lori Shepherd: lori.shepherd@roswellpark.org

# Workshop Description

This is a two part workshop. The first half of it will walk students through how 
to create a package using RStudio and the `devtools` package. This will be an 
instructor-led live demo, so as the student is creating their own package we 
will go over what we look for in Bioconductor packages. The second half of the 
workshop will go over the submission and review process for Bioconductor 
packages.

## Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of R syntax

## Workshop Participation

As the instructor creates and edits the package it is expected that students 
will follow along to create their own package. Questions from students are 
encouraged as we walk through the process, as this will most likely be their 
first time creating an R package.

## _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

* `devtools` will be used for creating, checking, documenting, and adding a 
vignette to the new package.
* `testthat` will be used for testing the new package.

## Time outline

Ideally we would prefer a 2 hour workshop, which is shown in the time outline 
below, but we could simplify to 1 hour if need be.
