# Create A Package

A package is a collection of functions that work together in a cohesive manner 
to achieve a goal. It (should) include detailed documentation through man pages 
and vignettes and (should) be tested for accuracy and efficiency. [Writing R extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html) 
is a very detailed manual provided by CRAN that explains writing packages and 
what the structure of a package should look like. This vignette is going to walk 
you through making your first package in RStudio as well as how to submitt a 
package to _Bioconductor_.

## Using `devtools` to create a package

The `devtools` package provides a lot of options and utility for helping to 
construct a new package. You can get a list of all available `devtools` functions 
with `ls("package:devtools")`.

Some useful references for using `devtools` to build packages are [Rstudio Devtools Cheetsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.pdf) and [Jennifer Bryan class](http://stat545.com/packages06_foofactors-package.html).

### Package shell
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
create("myFirstPackage")
```

`create()` will _create_ all the necessary files and sub-directories that are 
required by R to be a valid package: DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, and R directory. 
The DESCRIPTION file contains the basic information about the package and you 
will have to edit so that the information is pertinent to your package. The 
NAMESPACE file describes which functions will be imports and exports of the 
namespace. The R directory will contain the R code files for your package.

After running `create()`, the package has a vaild package structure which means 
it can be installed and loaded:
 
* `library("myFirstPackage")`,
* `library(help="myFirstPackage")`.

### Version control

It is an excellent idea to version control whenever creating a package and 
especially when collaborating on a project, where multiple users are allowed to 
make changes. Version control allows for a constant recored of changes that can 
be advanced or reverted if necessary.

Only a project can be version controlled and to make a directory a project in 
RStudio go to: `File -> New Project`. In this case we started creating the 
directory so we will follow the prompts for the option `Use Existing Directory`. 
Now that it is a project we can go to `Tools -> Version Control -> Project Setup` 
and change the `Version Control System` to `Git`, then follow the prompts. 
Notice in the RStudio pane for environments/history/build there is a new tab 
named 'Git'. The package can now start using `git` version control through 
making commits. To make a commit, you can go to the Git tab, select the check 
box next to any files that have been modified, added, or deleted that you would 
like to track, and select `commit`. Enter a new commit message in the window 
that pops up and select `commit`.

It is important to tell Git just who we are. In RStudio, select `Tools -> Shell` 
and type the following making sure to substitue *your* user.email and user.name.
If you have github we recommend using your email and user.name associated with 
github here. 

```
git config --global user.email "<someemail@gmail.com>"
git config --global user.name "<githubUserName>"
```

We could stop here but we also would like to put the package on GitHub. These 
next steps assume you have a github account. First, in RStudio go to `Tools -> 
Global Options` and select Git/SVN. Ensure the paths are correct. If you have 
not linked an RStudio project to GitHub, select `Create RSA key`. Close the 
window. Click on `View public key` and copy the displayed public key. Now in a 
web browser, open your GitHub accout. Go to `Settings` and `SSH and GPG keys`. 
Click on the option for `New SSH key` and paste the public key that was copied. 
Also on GitHub, create a new repository with the same name as the one you 
created with `create()` in RStudio. Back in RStudio, select `Tools -> Shell` and 
type the following making usre to substitue your GitHub user.name and the new 
package name.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<github user.name>/<package repo name>.git
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<github user.name>/<package repo name>.git
git pull origin master
git push -u origin master
```

For instance, this is what the commands would look like for me:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Kayla-Morrell/myFirstPackage.git
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Kayla-Morrell/myFirstPackage.git
git pull origin master
git push -u origin master
```

The `git remote add` command will create a new connection to the remote 
repository url and assign it the shortname 'origin' for easy referencing moving 
forward. Then the `git remote set-url` command is going to switch the 
url of the remote from 'https', which is public read only access, to 'SSH' so 
that you as a developer can have read and write access to the repository. `git 
pull` is going to fetch and download content from the remote repository and 
update the local repository to match. `git push` does the exact opposite, it 
will upload the local repo changes to the remote repo.

Now if you look in the RStudio tab for Git, the push and pull options are 
available. You can now push and pull from/to the local and GitHub repository 
version of your package.

## DESCRIPTION file

`devtools` provides built in functions for building, checking and installing a 
package. The package we created earlier using `create()` has a valid package 
structure but if we did `check()` we will find the DESCRIPTION file needs to be 
updated. The information in the DESCRIPTION file needs to be reflective of your 
package. These are the fields that should be changed:

* Title: Should be brief, but descriptive.
* Version: Should be 0.99.0 for pre-release packages.
* Authors@R: Only one person should be listed as maintainer (`cre`). We do 
accept Author/Maintainer for this field, either can be used but not both.
* Description: Should be relatively short but a detailed overview of what the 
package functionality entails.
* License: Preferably a standard license, Bioconductor core packages typically 
use Artistic-2.0. If using a non-standard license, must include a LICENSE file 
in your package and use `file LICENSE` in this field.
* LazyData: Should be set to false, we find that this field being true can slow 
down the loading of a package especially if it contains large data.

Throughout the development of your package you may have to update the 
DESCRIPTION file for appropriate Depends, Imports, and Suggests fields as you 
incorporate more functionality from other packages. As the package is developing 
we also require having a `biocViews:` field in the DESCRIPTION file. This field 
will contain at least two biocViews categories that reflect the nature of the 
package.

## R functions

Now we want to starting writing R functions. In RStudio you can open an empty 
file by doing `File -> New File` and selecting `R Script`. Save the file in the 
R directory. Write your functions and document. You can either document 
functions manually or if you use roxygen you can use the devetools function 
`document()`. See the [Writing R extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html) 
for manual creation of Rd files, which belong in the man directory, but roxygen 
is growing increasingly popular. Some helpful links for roxygen tags can be 
found at [RStudio Devtools Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.pdf) and 
[Roxygen Help](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html).

Some useful `devtools` commands while creating functions are:

* `load_all()` which loads all package functions in environment to test,
* `check()` which checks the package (R CMD check),
* `document()` which generates or updates any documentation files.

Using the RStudio options `Build -> Build and Reload` and `Build -> Clean 
and Rebuild` will also help with function creation.

It is also recommended to have a man page for you package. `devtools` provides 
a framework for this. To create the file that needs to be modified use the 
function `use_package_doc()`. 

If you import any functions in your code, don't forget to update the DESCRIPTION 
file for Depends, Imports, or Suggests. If the function provides essential 
functionality for users of your package, it belongs in Depends. It is unusual 
for more than three packages to be listed as Depends. For packages that provide 
functions, methods, or classes that are used inside your package namespace, they 
belong in Imports. Most packages will be listed here. For packages that are used 
in vignettes, examples, or conditional code, they should be listed as Suggests. 
This includes examples that may use annotation and/or experiment packages.

## Testing

It is highly recommened to add unit tests to your package. Unit tests unsure 
that the package is working as expected. The two main ways to test are using 
`RUnit` or `testthat`. `testthat` functionality is included in `devtools` by 
using `use_testthat()`. This function will set up the needed directory structure 
and add the package suggestion to the DESCRIPTION file. Here are some examples 
of the structure of tests for `testthat`:

* `expect_identical()`,
* `expect_true()`,
* `expect_error()`.

There are other options as well that are discussed in [testthat Wickham](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf) and [testthat](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html).

## Vignettes

Vignettes are another major documentation piece to a package. More and more 
repository systems (CRAN, Bioconductor, ROpenSci) are making vignettes a 
standard requirement. Vignettes are contain a more indepth description and 
examples of the package usage. `devtools` also provides the function 
`use_vignette()` to set up the directory structure and the initial file for 
a vignette. For Bioconductor submissions we recommend changing the `output:` 
section for the vignette header to the following, which would require adding 
`BiocStyle` to the Suggests field in the DESCRIPTION file, 

```
output:
  BiocStyle::html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
```

Or if `BiocStyle` is already installed on your system, you can also use RStudio 
to set up the vignette by doing `New File -> Rmarkdown -> From Template -> 
Bioconductor HTML/PDF Vignette`.

A helpful rmarkdown link, which is commonly used for vignette creation, can be 
found here: [rmarkdown cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf).

### Bioconductor Standards

Now that we have gone over the basics of how to create a package, we will review 
what we look for (generally) in Bioconductor packages. Being mindful of these 
guidelines while developing your package will help the whole submission process. 

1. Proper coding and efficient coding:

* [Efficient and Robust Code](http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/efficient-code/)
* [Query Web Resource](http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/web-query/)

2. Bioconductor interconnectivity and S4 classes

* S4 over S3 classes
* Reuse existing infrastructure first!
    + DNA/RNA - `Biostrings` `DNAstringset`
    + Gene sets - `GSEABase` `GeneSet`
    + Genomic intervals - `GenomicRanges` `Granges`
    + Rectangular feature x sample data - (RNAseq count matrix, microarray) - 
    `SummarizedExperiment`/`MuliAssayExperiment`
    + Single cell - `SingleCellExperiment`
    + Mass spec - `MSnbase`
    + import/loading data
        - GTF, GFF, BED, BigWig, ... `rtracklayer::import()`
        - FASTA `Biostrings::readDNAStringSet()`
        - SAM/BAM `Rsamtools::scanBam()`, `GenomicAlignments::readGAlignment*()`
        - VCF `VariantAnnotation::readVcf()`
        - FASTQ `ShortRead::readFastq()`
* [BiocViews](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software)

3. Tests

* [Unit test guidelines](http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/unitTesting-guidelines/)

4. Complete and detailed vignette(s) and man pages, with executable examples

5. Check time < 5 minutes

6. Package size < 5Mb

7. All package guidelines can be found [here](http://bioconductor.org/developers/package-guidelines/)

**IMPORTANT**: A clean build, check, and BiocCheck is not a guaranteed acceptance. 
The package will still go through a formal review process.

### Submitting to Bioconductor

Be sure to read the [Contributions Page](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions) and 
when you are ready to submit open a [New Issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions/issues). 
The Title: should be the name of your package. Once the package is approved for 
building, don't forget to set up the [remotes](https://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git/new-package-workflow/). 
Some details about the review process can be found [here](http://bioconductor.org/developers/package-submission/#whattoexpect).
